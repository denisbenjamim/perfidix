#Perfidix - No discussions, Just facts.

Perfidix is a light-weight java library enabling users to benchmark sourcecode.
Similar to JUnit, annotations can be placed before methods.
Within the invocation of these methods, flexible measurements are performed.
An eclipse plugin (Perclipse, available under https://github.com/disy/perclipse) offers easy usage of any annotated methods.

##5 steps how to use Perfidix

* Get the lastest jar over Github or Maven

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.perfidix</groupId>
	<artifactId>perfidix</artifactId>
	<version>4.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

* Annotate your methods to bench with "@Bench". Note that these methods have to have the following layout: "public (final) void method()" 
* Create a new "Benchmark" object and add the class with the annotated methods to it
* Get the BenchmarkResult by typing "benchmarkObj.run()"
* Display the result with the TabularSummaryOutput.visit(benchmarkResultObj). 

OR

* install the Perclipse Plugin over its update site (http://disy.github.com/perclipse/) and run over "Run As" (see the Perclipse-Readme for further information: https://github.com/disy/perclipse)

For further documentation and as an example, please refer to the org.perfidix.example package.
